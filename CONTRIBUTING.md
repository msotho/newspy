## Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Enhancements

Before creating a bug report, please check that your bug has not already been reported, and that your bug exists on the
latest version of Newspy.
If you find a closed issue that seems to report the same bug you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to
the original issue in your issue description.

Please include as many details as possible in your bug report. The information helps the maintainers resolve the issue
faster.

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/onemoola/newspy/issues) to track bugs and suggested enhancements.
You can report a bug by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/onemoola/newspy/issues/new/choose).

## Contributing to the codebase

Start by [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the Newspy repository, then clone your
forked repository using `git`:

### Picking an issue

Pick an issue by going through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/onemoola/newspy/issues) and finding an issue you
would like to work on.
Feel free to pick any issue that is not already assigned.
We use the [help wanted](https://github.com/onemoola/newspy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
label to indicate issues that are high on our wishlist.

If you are a first time contributor, you might want to look for issues
labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/onemoola/newspy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
The Newspy code base is quite complex, so starting with a small issue will help you find your way around!

You may use the issue to discuss possible solutions.
